ShiftRegister
=============
Shift registers, like counters, are a form of sequential logic. Sequential logic, unlike combinational logic is not only affected by the present inputs, but also, by the prior history. In other words, sequential logic remembers past events.

Here, we will be using a 74HC595 shift register IC to store data. 
An Arduino board will be used to control the shift regsiter.
